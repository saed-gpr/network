# Basic Network Knowledge
In this repository, I aim to share basic networking knowledge that is essential for understanding the field. If you aspire to become a network engineer, you should be familiar with these crucial topics.

### Topics

 We're going to learn about these topics
####  1 - Networking basics : 
   - Definition of network
   - types of network
       - LAN
       - WAN
     - Network topologies
       star, bus, ting, mesh, hybrid

  - OSI model : Explanation of the 7 layers
  - TCP/IP model

#### 2 - Network Hardware :
   - Routers and switches
   - Hubs and brigdes
   - Cables and connectors
   - Types of servers

#### 3 - Protocols :
   - Application layer protocols
       - HTTP/HTTPS
       - FTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP
       - DNS
   - Transport layer protocols :
       - TCP vs UDP
   - Networking layer protocols:
       - IP (IPv4 AND IPv6)
       - ICMP
   - Datalink layer protocols :
       - Ethernet
       - WI-FI (802.11 standards)
#### 4 - Ip Adressing :
  - IPv4 and IPv6 Adressing
  - subnetiing
  - private and public IP
  - NAT (networkind address Translation)
  - CIDR (classless inter-Domain Routing)

<h3>Network definition:</h3>
A network is a system where computers or even phones can communicate with each other, sharing data or connections.
There are two types of networks: LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network)

<h3>LAN :</h3>
A LAN network contains devices like laptops, printers, or phones that are located in a small area, such as a home or office.

#### The picture below shows a simple representation of a LAN network

<h3>WAN</h3>

Actually, a WAN is formed by connecting multiple LAN networks. This schematic will help you understand this concept.

As you can see, multiple LAN networks are connected to each other, forming a WAN network. This is how a WAN network is formed.
